      <h5 class="text-muted"> PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h5>
      <blockquote class="small text-dark"> A visitor can access and browse our entire site at any time without providing any personal information. We do not collect information that would personally identify you unless you choose to provide it.
      In addition, MEM does not share any personally identifiable information of any individual with any third party unrelated to MEM, except in situations where we must provide information for legal purposes or investigations, or if so directed by the patient through a proper authorization. </blockquote>
      <h5 class="text-muted"> Forms </h5>
      <blockquote class="small text-dark"> Our website contains forms through which users may request information or supply feedback to us. In some cases, telephone numbers, email addresses or return addresses are required so that we can supply requested information to you, and in other cases, correct names and addresses are required to process credit card payments.
      After you fill out a form, we may contact you with follow-up information (unless you have checked an "opt-out" box on the form). We do not provide any information supplied on our web forms to any outside organization for any reason (other than where we may be required to by law, or as necessary to process credit card information). We do not save this personal information for any other reason.

      <h5 class="text-muted"> Surveys</h5>
      <blockquote class="small text-dark"> Occasionally, we may survey visitors to our site. The information from these surveys is used in aggregate form to help us understand the needs of our visitors so that we can improve our site. We generally do not ask for information in surveys that would personally identify you. If we do request contact information for follow-up, you may decline to provide it.

We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through email.</blockquote>

      <h5 class="text-muted"> IP Addresses</h5>
      <blockquote class="small text-dark"> The Web server automatically collects the IP (which stands for Internet Protocol) address of the computers that access our site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you access the Internet. It is not truly personally identifiable information because many different individuals can access the Internet via the same computer. We use this information in aggregate form to understand how our site is being used and how we can better serve visitors.
      Please note that although such information is not personally identifiable, we can determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.</blockquote>
      <h5 class="text-muted"> First Party Cookies </h5>
      <blockquote class="small text-dark"> We collect information about visitors to our site using "first party cookies”, which are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. Cookies are never associated with specific personal identities. First party cookies are distinct from third party cookies that they are created and directly served by the company hosting the website.
      We use two types of “cookies” on this site:
      •	We use persistent cookies to recognize a repeat visitor, enabling us the opportunity to offer the visitor a set of services or information requested in a previous visit.
      •	We use session cookies to track a visitor's path through our site during a visit, to help us understand how people use our site.
      You can delete our cookies at any time. The "help" section, located on the toolbar of most browsers, will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. Since cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our website's best features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

      <h5 class="text-muted"> SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION </h5>
      <blockquote class="small text-dark">  Please note that our forms are encrypted to protect your privacy. Once the information is sent to our site, it is kept in secure databases where it is not available to users on the Internet. While we sometimes ask for credit card numbers or certain service transactions, and either pass them on to a credit card processing service or process them manually, we do not store credit card numbers online.
      MEM periodically reviews and modifies, where appropriate, its security policies and procedures. We use reasonable care to protect your personally identifiable and confidential information provided by you to our site. MEM has in place a security program that seeks to mitigate this risk substantially.</blockquote>
